# Explore Canada – Smart Travel Companion

"Explore Canada – Smart Travel Companion" is a **Node.js** web application that allows users to view **real-time weather forecasts** and **road events** in cities across **Canada**. The app uses data from **three public APIs**:

1. **OpenWeatherMap API** for current weather and geocoding.
2. **Open-Meteo API** for a **7-day weather forecast** (because OpenWeatherMap's 7-day forecast is a paid feature).
3. **Open511 BC API** for real-time **road events**.

This app is designed to help locals and tourists stay informed about the weather and road conditions in Canadian cities, all in one place.

<!-- Setting up OpenWeatherMap API -->

To get the API Key for OpenWeatherMap, follow these steps:

Go to OpenWeatherMap.

Sign up for an account if you don’t have one.

After logging in, go to the API keys section in your account settings.

Create a new API key and copy it.

Paste this API key into the .env file in the OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY field.

<!-- Why Open-Meteo for 7-Day Forecast? -->

Open-Meteo is used for fetching the 7-day weather forecast because OpenWeatherMap's 7-day forecast feature is paid. Here’s why Open-Meteo is the ideal solution:

OpenWeatherMap provides the current weather data for free, but for the 7-day forecast, they require a paid subscription for API access.

Open-Meteo offers free access to 7-day weather forecasts, making it an excellent choice for the weather forecast feature without incurring additional costs.

We use OpenWeatherMap for the current weather data and geocoding (getting city coordinates) because it’s a reliable, free API. Then, we use Open-Meteo to get the 7-day forecast based on the coordinates returned by OpenWeatherMap.
